This direction consists of two modules
  - geoloc.py
    the main function is to extract useful information from a OLD XLS file
    That may be removed in the future
  - tool4generate.py
    the main function is GENERATOR
    the synopsis writes : signals, groundtruth = generator(xsensors_m,settingfile)
    where xsensors_m is an M by 3 array and settingfile a text file name.
